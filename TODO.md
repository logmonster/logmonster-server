# add the Passport support
- logged in user could have full feature on the log generation (need to integrate with client side project as well; such as the protocol / interface in handling auth tokens)

# add logging 
- e.g. winston -> logging on multiple storage (transport); but in actual, only file or broker (messsage queue) would be necessary

# can create and manipulate pdf
- http://pdfkit.org/
- http://pdfkit.org/docs/getting_started.html
- e.g. create reports for the admin etc
- not sure if there would be some async tasks that need a report or email later... (though might not be the case)
